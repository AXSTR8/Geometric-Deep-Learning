# Group Equivariant CNNs
In this project, group-equivariant and steerable CNNs are tested. The first part examines their performance improvement on a dataset of randomly rotated MNIST data samples compared to conventional CNNs. 
The second part explores how these steerable CNN architectures outperform conventional CNNs on a dataset of images featuring randomly 3D-rotated geometric objects. This data is generated using Blender in Python.
